# Module 4: Web APIs Challenge - Code Quiz

## Description

This application is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 

The goal of this app is to help users become familiar with multiple-choice questions similar to those asked as part of an interview process.

## Installation

## Usage
 
The user is presented with a welcome page. When the user clicks the 'Start Quiz' button, a timer starts and they will be presented with a question.

After a question is answered, another one is shown, until the end of the quiz.

Whenever the user answers a question incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock.
Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over, and the user can save their initials and score.
